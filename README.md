# Codility Lesson Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to all the Codility tasks found here:
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/

These are my own solutions, and I have documented my code with comments explaining my approach. All solutions are 100% scored on Codility. I'm working on the solutions to all the tasks, so I will fill out the table as I am able to solve the problems.
